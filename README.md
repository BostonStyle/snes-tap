# snes-tap
This project includes Altium design files for an SNES tapping board.

Snes-tap V1.0
---------------------------------------------------------------------
This inital version of the board design files describes a simple adapter
board that converts the SNES bottom expansion port interface to a standard
100 mil IDC header for hardware interfacing. This interface gives you access
to the data bus and the peripheral address bus of the SNES. The interface also
gives you access to analog audio channels, the reset, the interrupt pin and a
couple of clocks.

TODO:
--------
The next version of the snes-tap will include a 5v to 3.3v logic translator for
easy interfacing to modern hardware chips.
